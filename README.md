# Word Guess Game

Game uses JavaScript and Web APIs.

## Instructions

How to use and play this game/application:

- To begin playing the game, click on the Start button up top.

- The game is timed.

- Guess the word by filling in a number of blanks by typing on your keyboard. If you type a letter that matches a space in that word, that letter will be revealed.

- To win the game, you have to guess all the letters in the word. And make sure to hit enter once the word is fully revealed. At this point, a "YOU WON!" banner appears in place of the word.

- If time runs out before you have guessed all the letters, you lose the game. At this point, a "GAME OVER" banner appears in place of the word.

- The app displays total wins and losses along with the timer.

- A reset score button is available to start from scratch.

## Javascript

- When a user presses a letter key, the user's guess is captured as a key event.

- When a user correctly guesses a letter, the corresponding blank "_" is replaced by the letter. For example, if the user correctly selects "a", then "a _ _ a _" should appear.

- When a user wins or loses a game, a message appears and the timer stops.

- When a user clicks the start button, the timer resets.

- When a user refreshes or returns to the brower page, the win and loss counts persists.
